Conway's game of life notes


Create a grid with one row to test

Then create a grid with three rows to test cell's full range

Create a function to allow cells to constrain the cell's search
range to stay within the grid.
    -If the cell is checking a column out of range, it gets normalized
    to reset to the beginning of the column


//Cell switching state function
        live_cell(cell) : bool
    -if a live cell contains < 2 neighbors, it dies
    -if a live cell contains >=3 neighbors, it dies
    -if a dead cell contians == 2 neighbors, it lives


Need to figure out how to get neighbor elements from cell function
